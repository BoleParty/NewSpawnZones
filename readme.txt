NewSpawnZones
Replacing Epoch default spawns with new created zones in a different location

/* New Central/ East/ West Spawns By BoleParty */

Here you got new Central/ East/ West Spawns.

I removed the standard Epoch spawns and static traders within the spawns and and replaced everything with new spawns and traders.

By default the spawns have a small safe zone included but to expand these i attached Friendlys "Extended Safe Zone Script".

Instructions:

No own changes/edits done to altis.h use this option:

download a3_epoch_server_settings.pbo (being located in @epochhive\addons).
unpack this .pbo and replace existing altis.h (being located in a3_epoch_server_settings\configs\maps) with attached one
repack the folder and upload to @epochhive\addons.
Altis.h file already been edited or changed?

Follow instrcutions in spawnzones.txt

Safe Zone Script:

download and unpack your epoch.altis.pbo (being located in arma3\mpmissions)
copy/paste safezone.sqf into your epoch.altis folder
open your init.sqf (if you dont have this file just create one) and add following code to it: [] execVM "safezone.sqf";
No own changes/edits done to mission.sqm use this option:

replace your mission.sqm with attached one
Mission.sqm already been edited or changed?

-Follow instructions in safezone.txt
